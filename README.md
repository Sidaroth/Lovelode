### Concerning object composing
This project uses a classless, object composing focused architecture, which may be unfamiliar to you. There are several reasons to do this, but the main reason is how adaptive this way of programming is. Have a look at https://github.com/Sidaroth/Phaser3.Boilerplate for more detail on this where we've done a small write up about it.
